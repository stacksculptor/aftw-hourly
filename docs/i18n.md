# i18n

The application supports having a single language for the UI. By default the language is English.

We are using the [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) package to translate UI texts and
to format dates, numbers, money values, etc.

To change the language, do the following:

1. Copy the default [src/translations/en.json](../src/translations/en.json) English translation
   messages file into some other file like `es.json`.

1. Change the messages in the new messages file to your language.

1. In [src/config.js](../src/config.js), change the `locale` variable value

1. In [src/app.js](../src/app.js), change the translation imports to come from the correct
   `react-intl` locale and the new messages file you created.
